# Business-Intelligence-Analysis-Report
A business intelligence analysis report created for a made-up company showing drilldown insights into the company's revenue and additional information. 

In this project, I created a simple business intelligence report using dataset from a fictional business revenue to enable stakeholders make decisons from insights derived from this analysis.
