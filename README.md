# Business-Intelligence-Analysis-Report
A business intelligence analysis report created for a made-up company showing drilldown insights into the company's revenue and additional information. 

In this project, I created a simple business intelligence report using dataset from a fictional business' revenue to enable stakeholders make decisons from insights derived from this analysis.

The dashboard can be seen and explored [here](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/78e8d082-978f-42f3-a4b7-90a278553982/ReportSection?experience=power-bi)
